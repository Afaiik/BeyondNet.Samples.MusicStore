# MusicStore
I am a musician (amateur being honest), then many times, I would like to have a tool that helps me with the organization. Mainly, having a clear order with my resources, ideas, and some important references. Therefore, this example app comes to help me with my daily activities.

Of course, this App is only experimental and it's not ready to be used in production.
